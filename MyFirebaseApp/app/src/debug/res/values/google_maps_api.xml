    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    AA:C5:4B:90:96:32:E9:CC:CF:02:06:09:32:15:41:58:A2:46:17:7F

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    AA:C5:4B:90:96:32:E9:CC:CF:02:06:09:32:15:41:58:A2:46:17:7F

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
