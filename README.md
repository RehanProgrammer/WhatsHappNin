# WhatsHappNin
The purpose of the What’s HappNin (WHN) application is to allow users to connect with their friends by sharing the activities that they are doing. The users can achieve this by utilizing a map which pinpoints the locations where all of the user’s friends are gathered and partaking in a social activity. When the user opens the app, they have the option to create an activity themselves by making a series of posts which indicate what kind of social activity the user is partaking in. Furthermore, the user will have the ability to upload comments, pictures or videos to keep their friends updated on the status of the event and entice friends to join. This will be accomplished on a map by including small features such as event icons and notifications that notify other users when posts are being made and of the location in which the activities are occurring. More specifically, the event icons on the map will include a symbol such as a basketball to let their friends know what type of event is taking place, the number of people of attending the event, and if clicked the event icon will redirect the user to the event feed. From this feed WHN users can see photos, comments, and videos that have been posted to an event. There will also be a point system in place to award users for creating or attending social events with their friends.
